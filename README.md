# Python_ML_TUM_demos
Machine Learning and Data Science Demos

This repository contains Python implementations of key Machine Learning and Data Science concepts. These examples are based on my studies and showcase my understanding of various techniques and their applications.
Contents

Regression
Script: 01_regression.py
Description: Implements regression analysis techniques for predictive modeling. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Script: 02_pca.py
Description: Demonstrates dimensionality reduction using PCA, focusing on feature extraction and visualization of reduced data.
Neural Networks
Script: 03_neural_network.py
Description: Builds and trains a basic neural network using a Python library. Explores concepts like forward propagation, backpropagation, and performance evaluation.
Purpose

The scripts in this repository serve as demonstrations of concepts I am currently studying in Machine Learning and Data Science. While these implementations are not my original creations, they reflect my ability to understand and work with the code effectively.
Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: (Include any libraries you used, e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
How to Use

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/PNeDIT/Python_ML_TUM_demos.git
Run the scripts in a Python environment of your choice.
Each script is self-contained and includes comments for better understanding.
